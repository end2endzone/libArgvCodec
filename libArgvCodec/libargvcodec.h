// PURPOSE:
//  
//  The libArgvCodec library is used when an application has to launch another one.
//  It includes arguments and command line encoder/decoder (codecs) that are
//  designed for the purpose of helping a developper in this situation. The
//  libArgvCodec library is designed to avoid typical encoding and decoding pitfalls
//  when transferring local variable values to other application through command
//  line arguments.
//
// HISTORY:
// 06/25/2017 v1.0 - Initial release.

// The following ifdef block is the standard way of creating macros which make exporting 
// from a DLL simpler. All files within this DLL are compiled with the LIBARGVCODEC_EXPORTS
// symbol defined on the command line. this symbol should not be defined on any project
// that uses this DLL. This way any other project whose source files include this file see 
// LIBARGVCODEC_API functions as being imported from a DLL, whereas this DLL sees symbols
// defined with this macro as being exported.
#ifdef LIBARGVCODEC_EXPORTS
#define LIBARGVCODEC_API __declspec(dllexport)
#else
#define LIBARGVCODEC_API __declspec(dllimport)
